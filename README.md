# This is a program that is designed to interface a motion detector to GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. 
# When the motion detector senses motion, the program calls up a video to display. 
# After a delay, the sequence will start over, waiting for the motion detector to be activated and the video to restart. 
# It's going to be so awesome!
